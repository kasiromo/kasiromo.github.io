                <h3>A QUICK NOTE</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    My original hope was to build this website with the clinic using Wordpress. However, I have not yet recieved a response from the clinic concerning whether working with me to create a website for them was something they were interested in pursuing.
                    As such, I ended up having to pivot to creating this "base" website, which is what I plan to use as inspiration for a Wordpress build of this site should I get the opportunity to create this site for them. :>
                </p>

                <h3>Project Function</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    The Ellenwood Animal Hospital website was designed to provide a clear, modern, and accessible online presence for the clinic. 
                    Its primary purpose is to allow users to quickly find important information, including services, clinic hours, location, and contact methods. 
                    Additionally, the website facilitates interactive tasks such as appointment requests and new client intake, enhancing client engagement and streamlining communication. 
                </p>

                <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    The design prioritizes <strong>clarity, accessibility, and professional aesthetics</strong>. 
                    Each section is enclosed within a card-style panel, giving content separation and focus. 
                    The grid layouts for services and team members ensure responsive organization, while call-to-action buttons provide intuitive interactions. 
                    Visual hierarchy is reinforced through typography, spacing, and subtle accent colors, guiding users naturally through the site.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical Concepts and Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    While this reflection page does not include dynamic functionality, the original project uses Vue.js to enable:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Dynamic content rendering:</strong> Services, team members, and testimonials are rendered from data arrays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive modals:</strong> Service details and appointment forms appear in pop-ups for streamlined interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smooth scrolling navigation:</strong> Users can navigate to sections quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Form handling:</strong> Intake, contact, and appointment forms include validation and user feedback using reactive Vue state.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Design and UX Principles Applied</h3>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><strong>Information architecture:</strong> Content is organized logically to minimize cognitive load.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> Grid layouts and flexible components adapt across devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual hierarchy:</strong> Font sizes, spacing, and accent colors guide user attention effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-centered design:</strong> Interactive features focus on practical tasks users need.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    Overall, this project allowed me to combine aesthetic design, technical implementation, and user-focused functionality. 
                    The site reflects the clinic’s brand and mission, while demonstrating modern web design principles and UX best practices.
