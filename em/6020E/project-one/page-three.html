            <h3 class="text-formatting-h3">ABOUT</h3>
                <p class="text-formatting-p">
                    Sleep Token is an anonymous band from the UK, fronted by the masked vocalist Vessel and backed by other anonymous members. They began making music around 2016 and gained serious traction with their blending of progressive metal, post-metal, djent, atmospheric music, ambient interludes, and emotional/clean vocals mixed with harsher elements. Their work often has strong dynamics, mood shifts, spiritual or ritual-like staging in live shows.
