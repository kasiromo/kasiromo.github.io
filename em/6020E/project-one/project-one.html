            <h1>Welcome to Kasi's Music Directory!</h1>
                <p>
                    I, like many others, love to listen to music. For me, music not only serves as a form of entertainment, but also serves as a grounding presence, motivational force, or spirit uplifter on those tougher days. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And while the scope of music that I listen to is not limited to these two genres, I must say that these two genres — <i>k-pop</i> and <i>metal</i> — hold incredibly special places in my heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, without further ado, please feel free to browse the <a href="page-two.html">K-Pop</a> and <a href="page-three.html">Metal</a> navigation tabs found at the top of this page. From there, you'll be introduced to some of my favorite artists within those respective genres. Hell, you might even discover a new musical artist to give a listen to!
