    <h1>P6: Cat Breed Showcase — Project Explanation</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My Cat Breed Showcase project uses <strong>Vue.js</strong> and <strong>Axios</strong> to pull
        real information and images from <a href="https://thecatapi.com" target="_blank">TheCatAPI</a>.
        The site lets users explore different cat breeds through mini slideshows, showing pictures,
        breed descriptions, where each breed comes from, and how friendly they are with children and dogs.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The main Vue app holds a list of five cat breeds and keeps track of which one is currently
        being shown. Each breed button connects to that list. When someone clicks on a breed button,
        Vue updates the page automatically by changing which breed ID gets passed into the
        <code>&lt;cat-slideshow&gt;</code> component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the component, <strong>Axios</strong> is used to request data from TheCatAPI. It first
        grabs several pictures of the chosen breed and then makes a second request to get more
        detailed info like temperament, origin, and friendliness ratings. The site shows one image at
        a time and uses a “Next Image” button to move through the set of images for the specified breed.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Dynamic Updates</h2>
      <p>
        One of the coolest parts of Vue is how it automatically updates what you see on the screen.
        Every time new data is loaded, the text and images on the page change right away without any
        page refresh. The site uses <code>{{ }}</code> to show things like the breed name or
        description directly in the HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project also includes small progress bars that show how dog-friendly and
        child-friendly each breed is. These bars are based on numbers from the API that range from 1
        to 5. I multiplied those values by 20 to turn them into percentages so they could fill the
        bars properly.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Component Setup</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>cat-slideshow</code> part of the project is a reusable Vue component that changes
        depending on which breed is selected. It uses a <strong>watch</strong> feature to notice when
        a new breed button is clicked. When that happens, it automatically runs the same API
        requests again but for the new breed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>slideshow()</strong> function loops through the list of image URLs from the API.
        Each time the “Next Image” button is pressed, it shows the next image and goes back to
        the first one once it reaches the end.

      <h2>Project Flow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The page loads with the default breed (American Bobtail).</li>
        <li>Axios gets that breed’s data and a batch of images.</li>
        <li>The breed name, description, and ratings appear below the image.</li>
        <li>Users can click “Next Image” to scroll through the photos.</li>
        <li>Clicking another breed button loads that new breed’s data instantly.</li>
      </ol>
